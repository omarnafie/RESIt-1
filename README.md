This Unity 2022.3 LTS project is a SpongeBob-themed 2D platformer where players control SpongeBob, navigating Bikini Bottom to shoot snails, jump obstacles, collect keys, and unlock doors. Speed power-ups enhance movement, while collisions with rocks or snails trigger game-over. Scores and progress persist locally via SQLite. The architecture employs MVVM, with Singleton (ScoreManager.cs) and Observer (Bullet.cs, Door.cs) patterns, ensuring modularity. Scripts (movement.cs, Shooter.cs, etc.) drive gameplay, with TextMeshPro UI and scrolling backgrounds. Developed using C#, the game supports iOS/Android, delivering an engaging experience with robust design and local persistence.
